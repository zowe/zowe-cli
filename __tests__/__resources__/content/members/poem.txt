I DIED for beauty, but was scarce                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Adjusted in the tomb,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
When one who died for truth was lain                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
In an adjoining room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
He questioned softly why I failed?                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
"For beauty," I replied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
"And I for truth -- the two are one;                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
We brethren are," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
And so, as kinsmen met a night,                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
We talked between the rooms,                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Until the moss had reached our lips,                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
And covered up our names.
