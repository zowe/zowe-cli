# Zowe CLI Releases

Zowe follows a regular release schedule with major versions released every two years and minor versions approximately every six weeks. Full details regarding the Zowe release schedule are available on [zowe.org](https://www.zowe.org/download#timeline) and the Zowe Community [Github](https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/Technical-Steering-Committee/release.md).

### Version Timeframes

- **Active**: Each major version remains in this phase for 2 years, receiving regular updates and new features.
- **Maintenance**: Following the Active phase, each major version remains in this phase for an additional 2.5 years, receiving only critical fixes and security patches.
- **Under Development**: The pre-Active phase where the next major version is prepared. This phase varies in length and is not available for general consumption.

### Guarantees

- **Critical Defects Fixes**: The community will fix critical defects. The criteria for what constitutes a critical defect can be found [here](https://github.com/zowe/community/blob/master/Technical-Steering-Committee/release.md#active-release).
- **Extender Conformance**: Extenders achieving Zowe conformance for the long-term support version will not need to modify their product to remain functional when Zowe updates are provided within the same major version.

### Recommendations

- **Production**: Use **Active** or **Maintenance** releases for production due to the guaranteed stability and the community’s commitment to fixing critical defects.
- **Nightly Builds**: Available for integration testing. Use at your own risk.
