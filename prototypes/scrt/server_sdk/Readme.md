This server_sdk folder contains an implementation for a new function to be added to an existing REST API SDK class.

The intended target within the REST API SDK for this new function is in the package

    com.broadcom.restapi.sdk.jfrs

The source file location for the new function incrementFeatCount() is:
    
    libs/security-spring/src/main/java\com\broadcom/restapi/sdk/jfrs/JfrsZosWriter.java

The App.java file is a simple driver program that can be compiled and run on a laptop to exercise the basic logic of the incrementFeatCount function.
