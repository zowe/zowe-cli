"================Z/OS CONSOLE ISSUE COMMAND HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   command | cmd

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Issue a z/OS console command and print command responses (known as \\"solicited
   command responses\\").

   In general, when issuing a z/OS console command, z/OS applications route
   responses to the originating console. The command response messages are referred
   to as \\"solicited command responses\\" (i.e. direct responses to the command
   issued). When issuing a z/OS console command using Zowe CLI, collection of all
   solicited command responses is attempted by default. However, there is no z/OS
   mechanism that indicates the total number of response messages that may be
   produced from a given command. Therefore, the Zowe CLI console APIs return a
   \\"solicited response key\\" that can be used to \\"follow-up\\" and collect any
   additional solicited command responses.

   Zowe CLI will issue \\"follow-up\\" API requests by default to collect any
   additional outstanding solicited command responses until a request returns no
   additional responses. At that time, Zowe CLI will attempt a final collection
   attempt. If no messages are present, the command is complete. If additional
   messages are present, the process is repeated. However, this does not guarantee
   that all messages produced in direct response (i.e. solicited) have been
   collected. The z/OS application may produce additional messages in direct
   response to your command at some point in the future. You can manually collect
   additional responses using the \\"command response key\\" OR specify additional
   processing options to, for example, delay collection attempts by a specified
   interval.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-console issue command <commandtext> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   commandtext		 (string)

      The z/OS console command to issue

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --console-name  | --cn | -c (string)

      The name of the z/OS extended MCS console to direct the command. You must have
      the required authority to access the console specified. You may also specify an
      arbitrary name, if your installation allows dynamic creation of consoles with
      arbitrary names.

      Allowed values: ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$

   --include-details  | --id | -i (boolean)

      Include additional details at the end of the Zowe CLI command response, such as
      the \\"command response key\\" and the z/OSMF command response URL.

   --key-only  | --ko | -k (boolean)

      Displays only the \\"command response key\\" returned from the z/OSMF console API.
      You can collect additional messages using the command key with 'zowe zos-console
      collect sync-responses <key>'. Note that when using this option, you will not be
      presented with the \\"first set\\" of command response messages (if present in the
      API response). However, you can view them by using the --response-format-json
      option.

   --return-first  | --rf | -r (boolean)

      Indicates that Zowe CLI should return immediately with the response message set
      returned in the first z/OSMF API request (even if no responses are present).
      Using this option may result in partial or no response, but quicker Zowe CLI
      command response time. The z/OSMF console API has an implicit wait when
      collecting the first set of console command responses, i.e you will normally
      receive at least one set of response messages.

   --solicited-keyword  | --sk | -s (string)

      For solicited responses (direct command responses) the response is considered
      complete if the keyword specified is present. If the keyword is detected, the
      command will immediately return, meaning the full command response may not be
      provided. The key only applies to the first request issued, follow up requests
      do not support searching for the keyword.

   --sysplex-system  | --ss | --sys (string)

      Specifies the z/OS system (LPAR) in the current SYSPLEX (where your target
      z/OSMF resides) to route the z/OS console command.

   --wait-to-collect  | --wtc | -w (number)

      Indicates that Zowe CLI wait at least the specified number of seconds before
      attempting to collect additional solicited response messages. If additional
      messages are collected on \\"follow-up\\" requests, the timer is reset until an
      attempt is made that results in no additional response messages.

   --follow-up-attempts  | --fua | -a (number)

      Number of request attempts if no response returned

      Default value: 1

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password  | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path  | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text

 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Issue a z/OS console command to display the IPL information
   for the system:

      $ zowe zos-console issue command \\"D IPLINFO\\"

   - Issue a z/OS console command to display the local and
   coordinated universal time and date:

      $ zowe zos-console issue command \\"D T\\"
