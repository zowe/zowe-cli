Syntax Error:
Missing Positional Argument: responsekey
Argument Description: The \\"solicited response key\\" provided in response to a previously issued console
command. Used by the z/OSMF console API to collect any additional outstanding
solicited responses from a previously issued console command.

Example:

 - Collect any outstanding additional solicited response messages:

      $ zowe zos-console collect sync-responses C4866969

Use \\"zowe zos-console collect sync-responses --help\\" to view command description, usage, and options.

"================Z/OS COLLECT RESPONSE HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   sync-responses | sr

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   The z/OSMF console REST APIs return a \\"solicited response key\\" after
   successfully issuing a synchronous console command that produces solicited
   responses. You can use the \\"solicited response key\\"on the \\"sync-responses\\"
   command to collect any additional outstanding solicited responses from the
   console the command was issued.

   In general, when issuing a z/OS console command, z/OS applications route
   responses to the originating console. The command response messages are referred
   to as \\"solicited command responses\\" (i.e. direct responses to the command
   issued). When issuing a z/OS console command using Zowe CLI, collection of all
   solicited command responses is attempted by default. However, there is no z/OS
   mechanism that indicates the total number of response messages that may be
   produced from a given command. Therefore, the Zowe CLI console APIs return a
   \\"solicited response key\\" that can be used to \\"follow-up\\" and collect any
   additional solicited command responses.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-console collect sync-responses <responsekey> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   responsekey		 (string)

      The \\"solicited response key\\" provided in response to a previously issued console
      command. Used by the z/OSMF console API to collect any additional outstanding
      solicited responses from a previously issued console command. Must match regular
      expression: ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --console-name  | --cn | -c (string)

      The name of the z/OS extended MCS console to direct the command. You must have
      the required authority to access the console specified. You may also specify an
      arbitrary name, if your installation allows dynamic creation of consoles with
      arbitrary names.

      Allowed values: ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path  | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text

 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Collect any outstanding additional solicited response
   messages:

      $ zowe zos-console collect sync-responses C4866969
