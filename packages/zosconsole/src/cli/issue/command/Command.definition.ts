    description: `Issue a z/OS console command and print command responses (known as "solicited command responses").` +
    `\n\n` +
    `In general, when issuing a z/OS console command, z/OS applications route responses to the originating console. ` +
    `The command response messages are referred to as "solicited command responses" (i.e. direct responses to the command issued). ` +
    `When issuing a z/OS console command using ${Constants.DISPLAY_NAME}, collection of all solicited command responses ` +
    `is attempted by default. However, there is no z/OS mechanism that indicates the total number of response messages that may be produced ` +
    `from a given command. Therefore, the ${Constants.DISPLAY_NAME} console APIs return a "solicited response key" ` +
    `that can be used to "follow-up" and collect any additional solicited command responses.` +
    `\n\n` +
    `${Constants.DISPLAY_NAME} will issue "follow-up" API requests by default ` +
    `to collect any additional outstanding solicited command responses until a request returns no additional responses. ` +
    `At that time, ${Constants.DISPLAY_NAME} will attempt a final collection attempt. ` +
    `If no messages are present, the command is complete. If additional messages are present, the process is repeated. ` +
    `However, this does not guarantee that all messages produced in direct response (i.e. solicited) have been collected. ` +
    `The z/OS application may produce additional messages in direct response to your command at some point in the future. ` +
    `You can manually collect additional responses using the "command response key" OR specify additional processing ` +
    `options to, for example, delay collection attempts by a specified interval.`,
