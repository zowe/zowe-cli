# Change Log

All notable changes to the Zowe z/OS files SDK package will be documented in this file.

## `8.27.4`

- BugFix: Updated minimum supported version of Node from 18 to 20. Added Node 24 support. [#2616](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2616)

## `8.27.3`

- BugFix: Fixed an issue in the `Copy.dataSetCrossLPAR` function that caused members to be falsely detected in the target PDS, causing some copy operations to fail when the `overwrite` option is `undefined` or `false`. [#2622](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2622)

## `8.24.0`

- Enhancement: Added an optional `searchExactName` option to the `ISearchOptions` interface to search the contents of one data set or PDS. [#2529](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2529)

## `8.23.0`

- Enhancement: Added support for the `IDownloadOptions.extensionMap` property to the `Download.allMembers` method to allow for specifying the file extension for each downloaded member. [#2507](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2507)

## `8.18.0`

- Enhancement: Added support for the `attributes`, `recall`, and `volume` options to the `List.dataSetsMatchingPattern` function. [#2476](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2476)

## `8.17.0`

- Enhancement: Adding the `responseTimeout` option to missing areas in the ZosFiles SDK so that the option is allowable on all methods. [#2467](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2467)

## `8.16.0`

- Enhancement: Added the ability to search data sets with regex patterns by setting `ISearchOptions.regex` to `true`. [#2432](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2432)
- Enhancement: Added optional field `ISearchMatchLocation.length` which provides the length of the match on a string. [#2443](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2443)

## `8.15.0`

- BugFix: Modified the `Copy.copyPDS()` function to have `sourceMemberList` as an optional parameter to avoid a breaking change. [#2453](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2453)
- Enhancement: Added the `overwrite` parameter to the `Copy.DataSet()` command to allow for overwriting all members of a target data set with source data set members. [#2450] (https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2450)

## `8.14.1`

-BugFix: When using the copy command with a non existent source data set, an unclear error was displayed to the user. Now, a more user-friendly message is provided [#2447] (https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2447).
-BugFix: The updated logic to determine whether a data set is a partitioned data set now ensures that the `dsorg` attributes of types `PO-E`, `PO-L`, `PO-U` are handled correctly. [#2390] (https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2390).

- BugFix: When using the `copy` command, if a target partitioned data set has a smaller record length than a source partitioned data set, the operation for subsequent members no longer stops. The user can now view the affected members in a local file. [#2349] (https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2349)
- BugFix: Users were not warned when copying partitioned data sets with identical member names. Now, the user is prompted to confirm before continuing the copy operation to avoid potential data loss. [#2349] (https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2349)

## `8.13.0`

- BugFix: The `Create.dataSetValidateOptions()` function now correctly handles data set creation when the `dsorg` attribute is set to `PS-L` by automatically updating the `dsntype` attribute to `LARGE`. [#2141](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2141)
- BugFix: Fixed an issue in the `Copy.dataSetCrossLPAR()` function where the `spacu` attribute of the copied data set was always set to `TRK`, regardless of the source data set's attributes. [#2412](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2412)
- BugFix: The `Copy.data.set` function now prompts the user to confirm before overwriting the contents of the target data set with the addition of the `--safe-replace` option. [#2369] (https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2369)

## `8.12.0`

- Enhancement: The `Copy.dataset` function now creates a new data set if the entered target data set does not exist. [#2349](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2349)
- Enhancement: Added the `maxLength` option to List SDK functions (`allMembers`, `dataSetsMatchingPattern`, `membersMatchingPattern`) to specify the maximum number of items to return. [#2409](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2409)
- Enhancement: Added the `start` option to List SDK functions (`allMembers`, `dataSetsMatchingPattern`, `membersMatchingPattern`) to specify the first data set/member name to return in the response. [#2409](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2409)

## `8.10.3`

- BugFix: The `Copy.dataset` method no longer copies all partitioned data set members if a member is passed to the function. [#2402](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2402)

## `8.10.0`

- Enhancement: The `Copy.dataset` method now recognizes partitioned data sets and can copy members of a source PDS into an existing target PDS. [#2386](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2386)

## `8.9.1`

- BugFix: Corrected the `apiResponse` response value from `streamToDataSet()`,`streamToUss()`,`bufferToUss()` and `bufferToDataSet()` on the Upload SDK. [#2381](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2381)
- BugFix: Corrected the `Upload.BufferToUssFile()` SDK function to properly tag uploaded files. [#2378](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2378)

## `8.9.0`

- Enhancement: Added a `List.membersMatchingPattern` method to download all members that match a specific pattern.[#2359](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2359)

## `8.8.4`

- Enhancement: Allows extenders of the Search functionality to pass a function `abortSearch` on `searchOptions` to abort a search. [#2370](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2370)

## `8.8.3`

- BugFix: Resolved issue where special characters could be corrupted when downloading a large file. [#2366](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2366)

## `8.8.0`

- Enhancement: Allows for passing a `.zosattributues` file path for the download encoding format via the `attributes` option on the `Download.ussFile` method. [#2322](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2322)
- BugFix: Added support for the `--encoding` flag to the `zowe upload dir-to-uss` to allow for encoding uploaded directories for command group consistency. [#2337](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/2337)

## `8.6.2`

- BugFix: Resolved issue where encoding argument was missing from `FileToUss.handler.ts` options object. [#2234](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2334)
- BugFix: Resolved issue where `FileToUss.handler.ts` options object was not properly passed through subsequent command calls. [#2234](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2334)

## `8.4.0`

- Enhancement: Added optional `--attributes` flag to `zowe zos-files upload file-to-uss` to allow passing a .zosattributes file path for upload encoding format. [#2319](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2319)

## `8.2.0`

- Enhancement: Added an optional `continueSearch` function to the `ISearchOptions` interface. After a data set listing is completed, the new function is called with the list of data sets about to be searched. This allows the extender or end users to continue with the search or cancel it. [#2300](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2300)

## `8.1.1`

- BugFix: Updated peer dependencies to `^8.0.0`, dropping support for versions tagged `next`. [#2287](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/pull/2287)
