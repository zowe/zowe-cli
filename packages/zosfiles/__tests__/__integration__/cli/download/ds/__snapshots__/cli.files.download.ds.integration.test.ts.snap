"================Z/OS FILES DOWNLOAD DATA SET HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   data-set | ds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Download content from a z/OS data set to a local file

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-files download data-set <dataSetName> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   dataSetName		 (string)

      The name of the data set that you want to download

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary  | -b (boolean)

      Download the file content in binary mode, which means that no data conversion is
      performed. The data transfer process returns each line as-is, without
      translation. No delimiters are added between records.

   --extension  | -e (string)

      Save the local files with a specified file extension. For example, .txt. Or \\"\\"
      for no extension. When no extension is specified, .txt is used as the default
      file extension.

   --file  | -f (string)

      The path to the local file where you want to download the content. When you omit
      the option, the command generates a file name automatically for you.

   --volume-serial  | --vs (string)

      The volume serial (VOLSER) where the data set resides. You can use this option
      at any time. However, the VOLSER is required only when the data set is not
      cataloged on the system. A VOLSER is analogous to a drive name on a PC.

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password  | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path  | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text

 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Download the data set \\"ibmuser.loadlib(main)\\" in binary
   mode to the local file \\"main.obj\\":

      $ zowe zos-files download data-set \\"ibmuser.loadlib(main)\\" -b -f main.obj
