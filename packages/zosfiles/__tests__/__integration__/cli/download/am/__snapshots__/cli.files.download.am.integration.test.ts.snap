"================Z/OS FILES DOWNLOAD ALL MEMBER HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   all-members | am

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Download all members from a partitioned data set to a local folder

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-files download all-members <dataSetName> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   dataSetName		 (string)

      The name of the data set from which you want to download members

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary  | -b (boolean)

      Download the file content in binary mode, which means that no data conversion is
      performed. The data transfer process returns each line as-is, without
      translation. No delimiters are added between records.

   --directory  | -d (string)

      The directory to where you want to save the members. The command creates the
      directory for you when it does not already exist. By default, the command
      creates a folder structure based on the data set qualifiers. For example, the
      data set ibmuser.new.cntl's members are downloaded to ibmuser/new/cntl).

   --extension  | -e (string)

      Save the local files with a specified file extension. For example, .txt. Or \\"\\"
      for no extension. When no extension is specified, .txt is used as the default
      file extension.

   --max-concurrent-requests  | --mcr (number)

      Specifies the maximum number of concurrent z/OSMF REST API requests to download
      members. Increasing the value results in faster downloads. However, increasing
      the value increases resource consumption on z/OS and can be prone to errors
      caused by making too many concurrent requests. If the download process
      encounters an error, the following message displays:
      The maximum number of TSO address spaces were created. When you specify 0, Zowe
      CLI attempts to download all members at once without a maximum number of
      concurrent requests.

      Default value: 1

   --volume-serial  | --vs (string)

      The volume serial (VOLSER) where the data set resides. You can use this option
      at any time. However, the VOLSER is required only when the data set is not
      cataloged on the system. A VOLSER is analogous to a drive name on a PC.

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password  | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path  | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text


 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Download the members of the data set \\"ibmuser.loadlib\\" in
   binary mode to the directory \\"loadlib/\\":

      $ zowe zos-files download all-members \\"ibmuser.loadlib\\" -b -d loadlib

   - Download the members of the data set \\"ibmuser.cntl\\" in text
   mode to the directory \\"jcl/\\":

      $ zowe zos-files download all-members \\"ibmuser.cntl\\" -d jcl
