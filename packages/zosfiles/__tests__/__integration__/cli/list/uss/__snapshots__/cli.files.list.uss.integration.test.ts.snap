      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of

   - Show the files and directories in path '/u/ibmuser
   displaying only the file or directory name:

      $ zowe zos-files list uss-files \\"/u/ibmuser\\" --rff name

   - Show the files and directories in path '/u/ibmuser'
   displaying the headers associated with the file detail:

      $ zowe zos-files list uss-files \\"/u/ibmuser\\" --rfh
