 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   file-system | fs

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   List all mounted filesystems, or the specific filesystem mounted at a given
   path, or the filesystem with a given filesystem name.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-files list file-system [options]

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --max-length  | --max (number)

      The option --max-length specifies the maximum number of items to return. Skip
      this parameter to return all items. If you specify an incorrect value, the
      parameter returns up to 1000 items.

   --fsname  | -f (string)

      Specifies the name of the mounted file system. This option and --path are
      mutually exclusive.

   --path  | -p (string)

      Specifies the path where the file system is mounted. This option and --fsname
      are mutually exclusive.

   --responseTimeout  | --rto (number)

      The maximum amount of time in seconds the z/OSMF Files TSO servlet should run
      before returning a response. Any request exceeding this amount of time will be
      terminated and return an error. Allowed values: 5 - 600

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password  | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path  | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

   --base-profile  | --base-p (string)

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --token-type  | --tt (string)

      The type of token to get and use for the API. Omit this option to use the
      default token type, which is provided by 'zowe auth login'.

   --token-value  | --tv (string)

      The value of the token to pass to the API.

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array)

      Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property
      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction
      with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single
      field/property or a list of a single field/property.

   --response-format-type  | --rft (string)

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-header  | --rfh (boolean)

      If \\"--response-format-type table\\" is specified, include the column headers in
      the output.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

   --help-web  | --hw (boolean)

      Display HTML help in browser

   --lcd  (string)

      Alternate local working directory

 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - To list all mounted filesystems:

      $ zowe zos-files list file-system

   - To list filesystems mounted to a specific path:

      $ zowe zos-files list file-system -p /a/ibmuser

   - To list filesystems mounted with a specific name:

      $ zowe zos-files list file-system -f MY.ZFS
