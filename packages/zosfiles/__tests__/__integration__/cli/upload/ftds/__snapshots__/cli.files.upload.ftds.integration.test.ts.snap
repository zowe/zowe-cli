"================Z/OS FILES UPLOAD DATA SET HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   file-to-data-set | ftds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Upload the contents of a file to a z/OS data set

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-files upload file-to-data-set <inputfile> <dataSetName> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   inputfile		 (string)

      The local file that you want to upload to a data set

   dataSetName		 (string)

      The name of the data set to which you want to upload the file

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary  | -b (boolean)

      Data content in binary mode, which means that no data conversion is performed.
      The data transfer process returns each record as-is, without translation. No
      delimiters are added between records.

   --migrated-recall  | --mr (string)

      The method by which migrated data set is handled. By default, a migrated data
      set is recalled synchronously. You can specify the following values: wait,
      nowait, error

      Default value: nowait

   --volume-serial  | --vs (string)

      The volume serial (VOLSER) where the data set resides. You can use this option
      at any time. However, the VOLSER is required only when the data set is not
      cataloged on the system. A VOLSER is analogous to a drive name on a PC.

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password  | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path  | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text

   --help-examples  (boolean)

      Display examples for all the commands in a the group

   --help-web  | --hw (boolean)

      Display HTML help in browser

 EXAMPLES

   - Upload file contents to a sequential data set named
   \\"ibmuser.ps\\":

      $ zowe zos-files upload file-to-data-set \\"file.txt\\" \\"ibmuser.ps\\"

   - Upload file contents to a PDS member named
   \\"ibmuser.pds(mem)\\":

      $ zowe zos-files upload file-to-data-set \\"file.txt\\" \\"ibmuser.pds(mem)\\"

   - Upload file contents to a migrated data set and wait for it
   to be recalled:

      $ zowe zos-files upload file-to-data-set \\"file.txt\\" \\"ibmuser.ps\\" --mr wait
