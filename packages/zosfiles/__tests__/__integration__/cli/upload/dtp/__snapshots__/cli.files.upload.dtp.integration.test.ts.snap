"================ Z/OS FILES UPLOAD DIRECTORY HELP ===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   dir-to-pds | dtp

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Upload files from a local directory to a partitioned data set (PDS)

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-files upload dir-to-pds <inputdir> <dataSetName> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   inputdir		 (string)

      The path for a local directory that you want to upload to a PDS

   dataSetName		 (string)

      The name of the partitioned data set to which you want to upload the files

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary  | -b (boolean)

      Data content in binary mode, which means that no data conversion is performed.
      The data transfer process returns each record as-is, without translation. No
      delimiters are added between records.

   --encoding  | --ec (number)

      Data content in encoding mode, which means that data conversion is performed
      according to the encoding specified.

   --migrated-recall  | --mr (string)

      The method by which migrated data set is handled. By default, a migrated data
      set is recalled synchronously. You can specify the following values: wait,
      nowait, error

      Default value: nowait

   --volume-serial  | --vs (string)

      The volume serial (VOLSER) where the data set resides. You can use this option
      at any time. However, the VOLSER is required only when the data set is not
      cataloged on the system. A VOLSER is analogous to a drive name on a PC.

   --responseTimeout  | --rto (number)

      The maximum amount of time in seconds the z/OSMF Files TSO servlet should run
      before returning a response. Any request exceeding this amount of time will be
      terminated and return an error. Allowed values: 5 - 600

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password  | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path  | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

   --base-profile  | --base-p (string)

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --token-type  | --tt (string)

      The type of token to get and use for the API. Omit this option to use the
      default token type, which is provided by 'zowe auth login'.

   --token-value  | --tv (string)

      The value of the token to pass to the API.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

   \\"ibmuser.src\\":

      $ zowe zos-files upload dir-to-pds \\"src\\" \\"ibmuser.src\\"

   - Upload a directory named \\"src\\" to a migrated PDS named
   \\"ibmuser.src\\" and wait for it to be recalled:

      $ zowe zos-files upload dir-to-pds \\"src\\" \\"ibmuser.src\\" --mr wait
