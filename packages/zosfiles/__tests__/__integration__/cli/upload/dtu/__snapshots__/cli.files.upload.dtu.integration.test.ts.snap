"================ Z/OS FILES UPLOAD LOCAL DIRECTORY TO USS DIRECTORY HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   dir-to-uss | dtu

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Upload a local directory to a USS directory

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-files upload dir-to-uss <inputDir> <USSDir> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   inputDir		 (string)

      The local directory path that you want to upload to a USS directory

   USSDir		 (string)

      The name of the USS directory to which you want to upload the local directory

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary  | -b (boolean)

      Data content in binary mode, which means that no data conversion is performed.
      The data transfer process returns each record as-is, without translation. No
      delimiters are added between records.

   --recursive  | -r (boolean)

      Upload all directories recursively.

   --binary-files  | --bf (string)

      Comma separated list of file names to be uploaded in binary mode. Use this
      option when you upload a directory in default ASCII mode, but you want to
      specify certain files to be uploaded in binary mode. All files matching
      specified file names will be uploaded in binary mode.

   --ascii-files  | --af (string)

      Comma separated list of file names to be uploaded in ASCII mode. Use this option
      when you upload a directory with --binary/-b flag, but you want to specify
      certain files to be uploaded in ASCII mode. All files matching specified file
      names will be uploaded in ASCII mode.

   --attributes  | --attrs (string)

      Path of an attributes file to control how files are uploaded

   --max-concurrent-requests  | --mcr (number)

      Specifies the maximum number of concurrent z/OSMF REST API requests to upload
      files. Increasing the value results in faster uploads. However, increasing the
      value increases resource consumption on z/OS and can be prone to errors caused
      by making too many concurrent requests. If the upload process encounters an
      error, the following message displays:
      The maximum number of TSO address spaces have been created. When you specify 0,
      Zowe CLI attempts to upload all members at once without a maximum number of
      concurrent requests.

      Default value: 1

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password  | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path  | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text


 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Upload all files from the \\"local_dir\\" directory to the
   \\"/a/ibmuser/my_dir\\" USS directory:\\":

      $ zowe zos-files upload dir-to-uss \\"local_dir\\" \\"/a/ibmuser/my_dir\\"

   - Upload all files from the \\"local_dir\\" directory and all its
   sub-directories, to the \\"/a/ibmuser/my_dir\\" USS directory::

      $ zowe zos-files upload dir-to-uss \\"local_dir\\" \\"/a/ibmuser/my_dir\\" --recursive

   - Upload all files from the \\"local_dir\\" directory to the
   \\"/a/ibmuser/my_dir\\" USS directory in default ASCII mode, while specifying a list
   of file names (without path) to be uploaded in binary mode::

      $ zowe zos-files upload dir-to-uss \\"local_dir\\" \\"/a/ibmuser/my_dir\\" --binary-files \\"myFile1.exe,myFile2.exe,myFile3.exe\\"

   - Upload all files from the \\"local_dir\\" directory to the
   \\"/a/ibmuser/my_dir\\" USS directory in binary mode, while specifying a list of
   file names (without path) to be uploaded in ASCII mode::

      $ zowe zos-files upload dir-to-uss \\"local_dir\\" \\"/a/ibmuser/my_dir\\" --binary --ascii-files \\"myFile1.txt,myFile2.txt,myFile3.txt\\"

   - Recursively upload all files from the \\"local_dir\\" directory
   to the \\"/a/ibmuser/my_dir\\" USS directory, specifying files to ignore and file
   encodings in the local file my_global_attributes::

      $ zowe zos-files upload dir-to-uss \\"local_dir\\" \\"/a/ibmuser/my_dir\\" --recursive --attributes my_global_attributes
