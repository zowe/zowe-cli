 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   data-set-sequential | ps

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Create physical sequential data sets (PS)

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-files create data-set-sequential <dataSetName> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   dataSetName		 (string)

      The name of the data set that you want to create

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --block-size  | --bs (number)

      The block size for the data set (for example, 6160)

      Default value: 6160

   --data-class  | --dc (string)

      The SMS data class to use for the allocation

   --device-type  | --dt (string)

      The device type, also known as 'unit'

   --directory-blocks  | --db (number)

      The number of directory blocks (for example, 25)

   --management-class  | --mc (string)

      The SMS management class to use for the allocation

   --record-format  | --rf (string)

      The record format for the data set (for example, FB for \\"Fixed Block\\")

      Default value: FB

   --record-length  | --rl (number)

      The logical record length. Analogous to the length of a line (for example, 80)

      Default value: 80

   --secondary-space  | --ss (number)

      The secondary space allocation (for example, 1)

      Default value: 1

   --show-attributes  | --pa (boolean)

      Show the full allocation attributes

   --size  | --sz (string)

      The size of the data set (specified as nCYL or nTRK - where n is the number of
      cylinders or tracks). Sets the primary allocation (the secondary allocation
      becomes ~10% of the primary).

      Default value: 1CYL

   --storage-class  | --sc (string)

      The SMS storage class to use for the allocation

   --volume-serial  | --vs (string)

      The volume serial (VOLSER) on which you want the data set to be placed. A VOLSER
      is analogous to a drive name on a PC.

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password  | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path  | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text


 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Create an empty physical sequential data set with default
   parameters:

      $ zowe zos-files create data-set-sequential NEW.PS.DATASET
