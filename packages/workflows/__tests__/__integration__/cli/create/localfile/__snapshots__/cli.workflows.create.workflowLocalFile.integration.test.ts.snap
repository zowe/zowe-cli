 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   workflow-from-local-file | wflf

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Create a z/OSMF workflow on a z/OS system using a Local file

      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of

 --------

   - Create a workflow with name \\"testworkflow\\" using the local
   file \\"TESTID_WKFLOW.xml\\" that contains the workflow definition xml on the system
   \\"TESTM1\\" with owner \\"OTHERID\\" and delete workflow with the same name if it
   already exist in z/OSMF:

      $ zowe zos-workflows create workflow-from-local-file \\"testworkflow\\" --local-file \\"TESTID_WKFLOW.xml\\" --system-name \\"TESTM1\\" --owner \\"OTHERID\\" --overwrite
