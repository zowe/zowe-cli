- The "@zowe/cli" package still includes both API and CLI methods. In addition, the following SDK packages are now available:
  - @zowe/provisioning-for-zowe-sdk

## `6.23.0`

- Enhancement: Added a `--pattern` option to the `zowe files list all-members` command. The option lets you restrict returned member names to only names that match a given pattern. The argument syntax is the same as the "pattern" parameter of the ISPF LMMLIST service. [#810](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/810)
- Enhancement: Added new options `--lrecl` and `--recfm` to the `zos-files create` command. Use these options to specify a logical record length and record format for data sets that you create. [#788](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/788)

## `6.21.1`

- BugFix: Renamed the z/OS Files API option from `storeclass` to `storclass`. This fixed an issue where the CLI could define the wrong storage class on `create dataset` commands. [#503](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/503)

## `6.21.0`

- Enhancement: Added a `--responseTimeout` option to the z/OS Files APIs, CLI commands, and z/OSMF profiles. Specify `--responseTimeout <###>` to set the number of seconds that the TSO servlet request runs before a timout occurs. The default is 30 seconds. You can set the option to between 5 and 600 seconds (inclusive). [#760](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/760)

## `6.20.0`

- Added API usage examples to each package Readme (files, jobs, etc...). [#751](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/751).
