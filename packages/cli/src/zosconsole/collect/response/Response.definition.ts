    `In general, when issuing a z/OS console command, z/OS applications route responses to the originating console. ` +
    `The command response messages are referred to as "solicited command responses" (i.e. direct responses to the command issued). ` +
    `When issuing a z/OS console command using ${Constants.DISPLAY_NAME}, collection of all solicited command responses ` +
    `is attempted by default. However, there is no z/OS mechanism that indicates the total number of response messages that may be produced ` +
    `from a given command. Therefore, the ${Constants.DISPLAY_NAME} console APIs return a "solicited response key" ` +
    `that can be used to "follow-up" and collect any additional solicited command responses.`,
