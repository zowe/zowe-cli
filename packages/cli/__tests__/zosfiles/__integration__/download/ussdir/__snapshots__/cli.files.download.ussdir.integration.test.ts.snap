"================Z/OS FILES DOWNLOAD USS DIRECTORY HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   uss-directory | uss-dir

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Download content from a USS directory to a local directory on your PC

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-files download uss-directory <ussDirName> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   ussDirName		 (string)

      The name of the USS directory you want to download

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --attributes | --attrs (local file path)

      Path of an attributes file to control how files are downloaded

   --binary | -b (boolean)

      Download the file content in binary mode, which means that no data conversion is
      performed. The data transfer process returns each line as-is, without
      translation. No delimiters are added between records.

   --depth (number)

      Filters content in USS based on the number of directories to traverse down.

   --directory | -d (string)

      The directory to where you want to save the files. The command creates the
      directory for you when it does not already exist. By default, the command
      downloads the files to the current directory.

   --encoding | --ec (string)

      Download the file content with encoding mode, which means that data conversion
      is performed using the file encoding specified.

   --fail-fast | --ff (boolean)

      Set this option to false to continue downloading USS files if one or more fail.

      Default value: true

   --filesys (boolean)

      Filters content in USS based on the filesystem the data is on. true - all
      filesystems, false - same filesystem as search directory.

   --group (string)

      Filters content in USS based on the owning group name or ID.

   --include-hidden | --ih (boolean)

      Include hidden files and folders that have names beginning with a dot

   --max-concurrent-requests | --mcr (number)

      Specifies the maximum number of concurrent z/OSMF REST API requests to download
      files. Increasing the value results in faster downloads. However, increasing the
      value increases resource consumption on z/OS and can be prone to errors caused
      by making too many concurrent requests. If the download process encounters an
      error, the following message displays:
      The maximum number of TSO address spaces have been created. When you specify 0,
      Zowe CLI attempts to download all files at once without a maximum number of
      concurrent requests.

      Default value: 1

   --max-length | --max (number)

      The option --max-length specifies the maximum number of items to return. Skip
      this parameter to return all items. If you specify an incorrect value, the
      parameter returns up to 1000 items.

   --mtime (string)

      Filters content in USS based on the last modification time. N - specify an exact
      number of days, +N - older than N days, -N - newer than N days

   --name (string)

      Filters files in USS based on the name of the file or directory.

   --overwrite | --ow (boolean)

      Overwrite files that already exist in your local environment

   --owner (string)

      Filters content in USS based on the owning user name or ID.

   --perm (string)

      Filters content in USS based on the octal permissions string.

   --size (string)

      Filters content in USS based on the size. Default units are bytes. Add a suffix
      of K for kilobytes, M for megabytes, or G for gigabytes. N - specify an exact
      file size, +N - larger than N size, -N - smaller than N size

   --symlinks (boolean)

      Filters content in USS based on whether or not to follow symbolic links. true -
      report symlinks, false - follow symlinks

   --type (string)

      Filters content in USS based on the type of content. f - regular file, d -
      directory, l - symbolic link, p - FIFO named pipe, s - socket

      Allowed values: f, d, l, p, s

   --response-timeout | --rto (number)

      The maximum amount of time in seconds the z/OSMF Files TSO servlet should run
      before returning a response. Any request exceeding this amount of time will be
      terminated and return an error. Allowed values: 5 - 600

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

   --protocol (string)

      The protocol used (HTTP or HTTPS)

      Default value: https
      Allowed values: http, https

   --cert-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication

      $ zowe zos-files download uss-directory /a/ibmuser --binary

   - Download the directory \\"/a/ibmuser\\" to \\"./localDir\\":

      $ zowe zos-files download uss-directory /a/ibmuser --directory localDir

   - Download files from the directory \\"/a/ibmuser\\" that match
   the name \\"*.log\\" and were modified within the last day:
