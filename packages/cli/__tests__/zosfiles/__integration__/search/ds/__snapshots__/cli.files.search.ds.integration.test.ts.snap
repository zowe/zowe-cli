"================Z/OS FILES SEARCH DATA SETS HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   data-sets | ds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Search all data sets and PDS members that match the data set name for a search
   term.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-files search data-sets <dataSetName> <searchString> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   dataSetName		 (string)

      The name of the data set(s) to perform the search against

   searchString		 (string)

      The parameter to search for

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --caseSensitive | --cs (boolean)

      The search should be case sensitive

      Default value: false

   --mainframeSearch | --ms (boolean)

      Perform a preliminary search on the mainframe, reducing network traffic

      Default value: false

   --max-concurrent-requests | --mcr (number)

      Specifies the maximum number of concurrent z/OSMF REST API requests to search
      files. Increasing the value results in faster searches. However, increasing the
      value increases resource consumption on z/OS and can be prone to errors caused
      by making too many concurrent requests.

      Default value: 1

   --timeout | --to (number)

      The number of seconds to search before timing out

   --response-timeout | --rto (number)

      The maximum amount of time in seconds the z/OSMF Files TSO servlet should run
      before returning a response. Any request exceeding this amount of time will be
      terminated and return an error. Allowed values: 5 - 600

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

   --protocol (string)

      The protocol used (HTTP or HTTPS)

      Default value: https
      Allowed values: http, https

   --cert-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication

   --cert-key-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

   --base-profile | --base-p (string)

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --token-type | --tt (string)

      The type of token to get and use for the API. Omit this option to use the
      default token type, which is provided by 'zowe auth login'.

   --token-value | --tv (string)

      The value of the token to pass to the API.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --show-inputs-only (boolean)

      Show command inputs and do not run the command

   --response-format-json | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help | -h (boolean)

      Display help text

   --help-web | --hw (boolean)

      Display HTML help in browser

 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Search all of IBMUSER's, data sets for 'ZOWE':

      $ zowe zos-files search data-sets 'IBMUSER.*' 'ZOWE'

   - Search all of IBMUSER's, data sets for 'ZOWE' in uppercase
   only:

      $ zowe zos-files search data-sets 'IBMUSER.*' 'ZOWE' --case-sensitive

   - Search all of IBMUSER's, data sets for 'ZOWE', and time out
   in 1 minute:

      $ zowe zos-files search data-sets 'IBMUSER.*' 'ZOWE' --timeout 60

   - Search all of IBMUSER's, data sets for 'ZOWE', and perform
   8 parallel tasks:

      $ zowe zos-files search data-sets 'IBMUSER.*' 'ZOWE' --threads 8
