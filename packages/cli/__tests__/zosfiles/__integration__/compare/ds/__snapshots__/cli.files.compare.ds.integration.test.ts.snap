"================Z/OS FILES LIST DATA SET HELP===============

 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   data-set | ds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   View content from a z/OS data set on your terminal (stdout).

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-files view data-set <dataSetName> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   dataSetName		 (string)

      The name of the data set you want to display.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --binary | -b (boolean)

      Transfer the file content in binary mode (no EBCDIC to ASCII conversion).

   --encoding | --ec (string)

      Transfer the file content with encoding mode, which means that data conversion
      is performed using the file encoding specified.

   --record | -r (boolean)

      Transfer the file content in record mode, which means that no data conversion is
      performed and the record length is prepended to the data. The data transfer
      process returns each line as-is, without translation. No delimiters are added
      between records. Conflicts with binary.

   --volume-serial | --vs (string)

      The volume serial (VOLSER) where the data set resides. You can use this option
      at any time. However, the VOLSER is required only when the data set is not
      cataloged on the system. A VOLSER is analogous to a drive name on a PC.

   --response-timeout | --rto (number)

      The maximum amount of time in seconds the z/OSMF Files TSO servlet should run
      before returning a response. Any request exceeding this amount of time will be
      terminated and return an error. Allowed values: 5 - 600

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

   --protocol (string)

      The protocol used (HTTP or HTTPS)

      Default value: https
      Allowed values: http, https

   --cert-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication

   --cert-key-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

   --base-profile | --base-p (string)

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --token-type | --tt (string)

      The type of token to get and use for the API. Omit this option to use the
      default token type, which is provided by 'zowe auth login'.

   --token-value | --tv (string)

      The value of the token to pass to the API.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --show-inputs-only (boolean)

      Show command inputs and do not run the command

   --response-format-json | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help | -h (boolean)

      Display help text

   --help-examples (boolean)

      Display examples for all the commands in a group

   --help-web | --hw (boolean)

      Display HTML help in browser

 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - View the contents of the data set member
   \\"ibmuser.cntl(iefbr14)\\":

      $ zowe zos-files view data-set \\"ibmuser.cntl(iefbr14)\\"

   - View the contents of the data set member
   \\"ibmuser.test.loadlib(main)\\" in binary mode:

      $ zowe zos-files view data-set \\"ibmuser.test.loadlib(main)\\" --binary
