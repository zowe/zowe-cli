 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   apiml

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Log in to Zowe API Mediation Layer authentication service and obtain or update a
   token.

   The token provides authentication to services that support the API ML SSO
   (Single Sign-On) capability. When you log in, the token is stored in your
   default base profile until it expires. Base profiles store connection
   information shared by multiple services (e.g., z/OSMF), and are used if you do
   not supply connection information in a service profile. To take advantage of the
   API ML SSO capability, you should omit username and password in service profiles
   so that the token in the base profile is used.
