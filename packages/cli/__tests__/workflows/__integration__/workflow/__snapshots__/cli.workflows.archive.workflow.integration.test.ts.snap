      Display HTML help in browser

 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Archive a workflow with workflow name \\"testworkflow\\":

      $ zowe zos-workflows archive active-workflow --wn \\"testworkflow\\" 

   - Archive multiple workflows with workflow names starting
   with \\"test\\":

      $ zowe zos-workflows archive active-workflow --wn \\"test.*\\" 

   - Archive a workflow with workflow key \\"123-456-abv-xyz\\":

      $ zowe zos-workflows archive active-workflow --wk \\"123-456-abv-xyz\\"
