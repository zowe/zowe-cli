 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   workflowName		 (string)

 REQUIRED OPTIONS
 ----------------

   --uss-file  | --uf (string)

      Uss file that contains workflow definiton.

   --system-name  | --sn (string)

      z/OS system to execute the workflow.

   --owner  | --ow (string)

      User ID of the workflow owner. This user can perform the workflow steps or
      delegate the steps to other users.

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --variables-input-file  | --vif (string)

      Specifies an optional properties file that you can use to pre-specify values for
      one or more of the variables that are defined in the workflow definition file.

   --variables  | --vs (string)

      Includes a list of variables for the workflow. The variables that you specify
      here take precedence over the variables that are specified in the workflow
      variable input file. Make sure the value meets all regular expression
      requirements set for the corresponding variable.

   --assign-to-owner  | --ato (boolean)

      Indicates whether the workflow steps are assigned to the workflow owner.

   --access-type  | --at (string)

      Specifies the access type for the workflow. Public, Restricted or Private.

      Allowed values: Public, Restricted, Private

   --delete-completed  | --dc (boolean)

      Whether the successfully completed jobs to be deleted from the JES spool.

   --overwrite  | --ov (boolean)

      Replaces an existing workflow with a new workflow.

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS

   --host  | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path  | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

   --protocol  (string)

      The protocol used (HTTP or HTTPS)

      Default value: https
      Allowed values: http, https

   --cert-file  (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication

   --cert-key-file  (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --token-type  | --tt (string)

      default token type, which is provided by 'zowe auth login'.

   --token-value  | --tv (string)

      The value of the token to pass to the API.

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array)

      Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property
      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction
      with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single
      field/property or a list of a single field/property.

   --response-format-type  | --rft (string)

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string
