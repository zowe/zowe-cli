 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   old-jobs | oj

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Delete (purge) jobs in OUTPUT status. Defaults to deleting all jobs owned by
   your user ID that are in output status.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-jobs delete old-jobs [options]

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --prefix | -p (string)

      Only delete jobs with job names that match this prefix. Defaults to deleting all
      jobs owned by your user ID that are in output status.

   --max-concurrent-requests | --mcr (number)

      Specifies the maximum number of concurrent z/OSMF REST API requests to delete
      jobs. Increasing the value makes the command run faster. However, increasing the
      value increases resource consumption on z/OS and can be prone to errors caused
      by making too many concurrent requests. When you specify 0, Zowe CLI attempts to
      delete all jobs at once without a maximum number of concurrent requests.

      Default value: 1

   --modify-version (string)

      Using this option to set X-IBM-Job-Modify-Version to \\"1.0\\" will make the delete
      job API asynchronous. Otherwise, it will be synchronous by default.

      Default value: 2.0

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

   --protocol (string)

      The protocol used (HTTP or HTTPS)

      Default value: https
      Allowed values: http, https

   --cert-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication

   --cert-key-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

   --base-profile | --base-p (string)

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --token-type | --tt (string)

      The type of token to get and use for the API. Omit this option to use the
      default token type, which is provided by 'zowe auth login'.

      The value of the token to pass to the API.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --show-inputs-only (boolean)
