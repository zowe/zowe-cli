 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   old-jobs | oj

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Delete (purge) jobs in OUTPUT status. Defaults to deleting all jobs owned by
   your user ID that are in output status.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-jobs delete old-jobs [options]

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --prefix | -p (string)

      Only delete jobs with job names that match this prefix. Defaults to deleting all
      jobs owned by your user ID that are in output status.

   --max-concurrent-requests | --mcr (number)

      Specifies the maximum number of concurrent z/OSMF REST API requests to delete
      jobs. Increasing the value makes the command run faster. However, increasing the
      value increases resource consumption on z/OS and can be prone to errors caused
      by making too many concurrent requests. When you specify 0, Zowe CLI attempts to
      delete all jobs at once without a maximum number of concurrent requests.

      Default value: 1

   --modify-version (string)

      Using this option to set X-IBM-Job-Modify-Version to \\"1.0\\" will make the delete
      job API asynchronous. Otherwise, it will be synchronous by default.

      Default value: 2.0

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

   --protocol (string)

      The protocol used (HTTP or HTTPS)

      Default value: https
      Allowed values: http, https

   --cert-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate file to use for authentication

   --cert-key-file (local file path)

      The file path to a certificate key file to use for authentication

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

   --base-profile | --base-p (string)

      The name of a (base) profile to load for this command execution.

 BASE CONNECTION OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --token-type | --tt (string)

      The type of token to get and use for the API. Omit this option to use the
      default token type, which is provided by 'zowe auth login'.

 --------------

   --show-inputs-only (boolean)

      Display HTML help in browser
