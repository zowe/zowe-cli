 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array)

      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction

      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry

      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
