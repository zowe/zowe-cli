 COMMAND NAME
 ------------

   data-set | ds

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

   Submit a job (JCL) contained in a data set. The data set may be of type physical
   sequential or a PDS member. The command does not pre-validate the data set name.
   The command presents errors verbatim from the z/OSMF Jobs REST endpoints. For
   more information about z/OSMF Jobs API errors, see the z/OSMF Jobs API REST
   documentation.

 USAGE
 -----

   zowe zos-jobs submit data-set <dataset> [options]

 POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
 --------------------

   dataset		 (string)

      The z/OS data set containing the JCL to submit. You can specify a physical
      sequential data set (for example, \\"DATA.SET\\") or a partitioned data set
      qualified by a member (for example, \\"DATA.SET(MEMBER)\\").

 OPTIONS
 -------

   --volume  | --vol (string)

      The volume serial (VOLSER) where the data set resides. The option is required
      only when the data set is not catalogued on the system.

   --view-all-spool-content  | --vasc (boolean)

      Print all spool output. If you use this option you will wait the job to
      complete.

   --directory  | -d (string)

      The local directory you would like to download the output of the job. Creates a
      subdirectory using the jobID as the name and files are titled based on DD names.
      If you use this option you will wait the job to complete.

   --extension  | -e (string)

      A file extension to save the job output with. Default is '.txt'.

 ZOSMF CONNECTION OPTIONS
 ------------------------

   --host  | -H (string)

      The z/OSMF server host name.

   --port  | -P (number)

      The z/OSMF server port.

      Default value: 443

   --user  | -u (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) user name, which can be the same as your TSO login.

   --password  | --pass | --pw (string)

      Mainframe (z/OSMF) password, which can be the same as your TSO password.

   --reject-unauthorized  | --ru (boolean)

      Reject self-signed certificates.

      Default value: true

   --base-path  | --bp (string)

      The base path for your API mediation layer instance. Specify this option to
      prepend the base path to all z/OSMF resources when making REST requests. Do not
      specify this option if you are not using an API mediation layer.

 PROFILE OPTIONS
 ---------------

   --zosmf-profile  | --zosmf-p (string)

      The name of a (zosmf) profile to load for this command execution.

 RESPONSE FORMAT OPTIONS
 -----------------------

   --response-format-filter  | --rff (array)

      Filter (include) fields in the response. Accepts an array of field/property
      names to include in the output response. You can filter JSON objects properties
      OR table columns/fields. In addition, you can use this option in conjunction
      with '--response-format-type' to reduce the output of a command to a single
      field/property or a list of a single field/property.

   --response-format-type  | --rft (string)

      The command response output format type. Must be one of the following:

      table: Formats output data as a table. Use this option when the output data is
      an array of homogeneous JSON objects. Each property of the object will become a
      column in the table.

      list: Formats output data as a list of strings. Can be used on any data type
      (JSON objects/arrays) are stringified and a new line is added after each entry
      in an array.

      object: Formats output data as a list of prettified objects (or single object).
      Can be used in place of \\"table\\" to change from tabular output to a list of
      prettified objects.

      string: Formats output data as a string. JSON objects/arrays are stringified.

      Allowed values: table, list, object, string

   --response-format-header  | --rfh (boolean)

      If \\"--response-format-type table\\" is specified, include the column headers in
      the output.

 GLOBAL OPTIONS
 --------------

   --response-format-json  | --rfj (boolean)

      Produce JSON formatted data from a command

   --help  | -h (boolean)

      Display help text


 EXAMPLES
 --------

   - Submit the JCL in the data set \\"ibmuser.cntl(deploy)\\":

      $ zowe zos-jobs submit data-set \\"ibmuser.cntl(deploy)\\"

   - Submit the JCL in the data set \\"ibmuser.cntl(deploy)\\", wait
   for the job to complete and print all output from the job:

      $ zowe zos-jobs submit data-set \\"ibmuser.cntl(deploy)\\" --vasc
