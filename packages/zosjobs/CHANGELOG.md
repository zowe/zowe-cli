# Change Log

All notable changes to the Zowe z/OS jobs SDK package will be documented in this file.

## Recent Changes
-BugFix: Enabled option to download output from a submitted job with the "directory" option. The `IDownloadSpoolContentParms` interface now supports an "extension" flag which enables changes to file extension as originally intended. [#729](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/729)

## `7.10.4`
- BugFix: Changed default value for modify-jobs option in the CancelJobs and DeleteJobs classes to 2.0. This change results in calls to z/OSMF becoming synchronous, and a successful response from the modify, cancel, and delete commands indicates the requested action was completed successfully.
