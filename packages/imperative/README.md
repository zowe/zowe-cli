Imperative CLI Framework is a command processing system that lets you quickly build customized command-line interfaces. Prior to V3 of the Zowe CLI, Imperative was a seperate package. It is now fully integrated with the CLI where it continues to provide groundwork for CLI infrastrure, functionality and plug-ins.
## Software Requirements

- [**Install Node.js package manager**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) on your computer. Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime environment on which we architected Imperative CLI Framework.

- You must have a means to execute ".sh" (bash) scripts to run integration tests. On Windows, you can install "Git Bash", which is bundled with the standard [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installation - (choose the "Use Git and Unix Tools from Windows Command Prompt" installation option). When you run the integration tests on Windows, you must have Administrative authority to enable the integration tests to create symbolic links.

> [!WARNING]
> Broadcom Inc. does not maintain the prerequisite software that Imperative CLI Framework requires. You are responsible for updating Node.js and other prerequisites on your computer. We recommend that you update Node.js regularly to the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version.

## Install Imperative as a Dependency

Issue the following commands to install Imperative CLI Framework as a dependency.

- **Install `@latest` version:**

    Be aware that if you update via `@latest`, you accept breaking changes into your project.

    ``` bash
    npm install @zowe/imperative
    ```

- **Install `@zowe-v3-lts` version:**

    This is a Long Term Support release that is guaranteed to have no breaking changes.

    ``` bash
    npm install @zowe/imperative@zowe-v3-lts
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to install the bleeding edge version of Imperative, you can append
> `--@zowe:registry=https://zowe.jfrog.io/zowe/api/npm/npm-release/` to the install command to get it from a staging registry. It is not recommended to use this registry for production dependencies.
