## `4.9.0`

## `4.8.0`

## `4.7.6`

- Enhancement: Added support for dynamically generated cookie names. Updated `AbstractSession.storeCookie()` to process cookie names that are not fully known at build-time. [#431](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/pull/431)

## `4.7.5`

- BugFix: Added support for creating an array with `allowableValues`. Previously, array type options could fail in the Syntax Validator. [#428](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/428)

## `4.7.4`

- Fix update profile API storing secure fields incorrectly when called without CLI args

## `4.7.3`

- Fix web help failing to load in Internet Explorer 11
- Fix `--help-web` not working on macOS when DISPLAY environment variable is undefined
- Change type of `ISession.tokenType` to "string" (for compatiblity with versions older than 4.7.0).

## `4.7.2`

- Hide sensitive session properties (user, password, and token value) in log file. Since 4.7.0, only password was hidden.

## `4.7.1`

- Don't load token value into Session object if user or password are supplied

## `4.7.0`

- Add the --dd flag to profile creation to allow the profile to be created without the default values specified for that profile.
- Use a token for authentication if a token is present in the underlying REST session object.
- Added a new ConnectionPropsForSessCfg.addPropsOrPrompt function that places credentials (including a possible token) into a session configuration object.
    - Plugins must use this function to create their sessions to gain the features of automatic token-handling and prompting for missing connection options.
    - Connection information is obtained from the command line, environment variables, a service profile, a base profile, or from an option's default value in a service profile's definition, in that order.
    - If key connection information is not supplied to any cor Zowe command, the command will prompt for:
        -  host
        -  port
        -  user
        -  and password
    - Any prompt will timeout after 30 seconds so that it will not hang an automated script.
- Add base profiles, a new type of profile which can store values shared between profiles of other types.
    - The properties that are currently recognized in a base profile are:
        - host
        - port
        - user
        - password
        - rejectUnauthorized
        - tokenType
        - tokenValue
    - To use base profiles in an Imperative-based CLI, define a `baseProfile` schema on your Imperative configuration object.
    - If the `baseProfile` schema is defined, base profile support will be added to any command that uses profiles.
- Due to new options (like tokenValue) help text will change. Plugin developers may have to update any mismatched snapshots in their automated tests.
- Updated the version of TypeScript from 3.7.4 to 3.8.0.
- Updated the version of TSLint from 5.x to 6.1.2.
- Add login and logout commands to get and delete/invalidate tokens
  - Add showToken flag to display token only, and not save it to the user profile
  - Add ability to create a user profile on login if no profile of that type existed previously
