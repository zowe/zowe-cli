## `5.0.0-next.202203072228`

- BugFix: Removed extra space in help text following option name [#745](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/745).
- BugFix: Fixed Ctrl+C (SIGINT) response to CLI prompts throwing an error rather than exiting silently.

## `5.0.0-next.202202232039`

- Enhancement: Added `stdin` property to `IHandlerParameters` which defaults to `process.stdin` and can be overridden with another readable stream in daemon mode.
  - This may be a breaking change for unit tests that mock the `IHandlerParameters` interface since a required property has been added.
- **Next Breaking**: Replaced `IYargsContext` interface with `IDaemonContext` and renamed `yargsContext` property of `ImperativeConfig.instance` to `daemonContext`. A context object is no longer supplied to `yargs` since it gets parsed as CLI arguments which is undesired behavior.

## `5.0.0-next.202202111730`

- **Next Breaking**: Changed the default behavior of `Config.save` and `ConfigSecure.save` APIs to save only the active config layer. [#732](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/732)

## `5.0.0-next.202112151934`

- BugFix: Removed `@internal` methods from type declarations so they don't appear in IntelliSense. [#679](https://github.com/zowe/imperative/issues/679)
- BugFix: Made the `ProfileInfo.initSessCfg` method public for easier instantiation of classes that extend AbstractSession.
- Deprecated: All methods in the `IHandlerParameters.profiles` class. Use the `ConfigProfiles` API for team config instead.

## `5.0.0-next.202112132158`

- Enhancement: Added an environment variable to control whether or not sensitive data will be masked in the console output.<br/>
    This behavior excludes any TRACE level logs for both, Imperative.log and AppName.log.<br/>
    This behavior also excludes properties defined as secure by the plugin developers.<br/>
    If the schema definition is not found, we will exclude the following properties: user, password, tokenValue, and keyPassphrase.<br/>

## `5.0.0-next.202111032034`

- Enhancement: Added `autoStore` property to config JSON files which defaults to true. When this property is enabled and the CLI prompts you to enter connection info, the values you enter will be saved to disk (or credential vault if they are secure) for future use. [zowe/zowe-cli#923](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/923)
- **Next Breaking**
    - Changed the default behavior of `Config.set` so that it no longer coerces string values to other types unless the `parseString` option is true.

- BugFix: Fixed secure credentials not being stored by the `config auto-init` command.

## `5.0.0-next.202107092101`

- Enhancement: Adds the `config auto-init` base handler and command builder, allowing a CLI to build a configuration auto-initialization command and handler
- Enhancement: Adds the optional `configAutoInitCommandConfig` interface to the IImperativeConfig interface, allowing for an auto-init command to be generated if a CLI supports it
- Enhancement: Better support for comments in JSON
- Bugfix: Revert schema changes related to additionalProperties. Re-enable IntelliSense when editing zowe.config.json files
- **Next Breaking**

    - Replaced --global with --global-config on all config command groups for consistency

## `5.0.0-next.202106212048`

- Enhancement: A new interface (IApimlSvcAttrs) was added. A property (apimlConnLookup) of that interface type was added to IImperativeConfig to enable plugins to tie themselves to an APIML service. Zowe-CLI can then ask APIML for the configuration data for the plugin to connect to that service.

## `5.0.0-next.202106041929`

- **LTS Breaking**: Removed the following previously deprecated items:
    - ICliLoadProfile.ICliILoadProfile -- use ICliLoadProfile.ICliLoadProfile
    - IImperativeErrorParms.suppressReport -- has not been used since 10/17/2018
    - IImperativeConfig.pluginBaseCliVersion -- has not been used since version 1.0.1

## `5.0.0-next.202104262004`

- Enhancement: Remove message about NPM peer dep warnings that no longer applies to npm@7.
- **LTS Breaking**: Imperative no longer requires plug-ins to include CLI package as a peer dependency. It is recommended that CLI plug-ins remove their peer dependency on @zowe/cli for improved compatibility with npm@7. This is a breaking change for plug-ins, as older versions of Imperative will fail to install a plug-in that lacks the CLI peer dependency.

## `5.0.0-next.202104140156`

- BugFix: Allow SCS to load new securely stored credentials. [#984](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-cli/issues/984)

    - Transparently read either a new team configuration or old style profiles.
    - Resolve order of precedence for profile argument values.
    - Provide information to enable callers to prompt for missing profile arguments.
    - Retain the location in which a profile or argument was found.
    - Automatically initialize CredentialManager, including an option to specify a custom keytar module.
    - Provide a means to postpone the loading of secure arguments until specifically requested by the calling app to delay loading sensitive data until it is needed.
    - Provide access to the lower-level Config API to fully manipulate the team configuration file.

## `5.0.0-next.202101281717`

- Enhancement: Added new config API intended to replace the profiles API, and new "config" command group to manage config JSON files. The new API makes it easier for users to create, share, and switch between profile configurations.
- Deprecated: The "profiles" command group for managing global profiles in "{cliHome}/profiles". Use the new "config" command group instead.
- **LTS Breaking**: Removed "config" command group for managing app settings in "{cliHome}/imperative/settings.json". If app settings already exist they are still loaded for backwards compatibility. For storing app settings use the new config API instead.
- Enhancement: Added support for secure credential storage without any plug-ins required. Include the "keytar" package as a dependency in your CLI to make use of it.
- Enhancement: Added `deprecatedReplacement` property to `ICommandDefinition` to deprecate a command.

## `4.7.3`

- Fix web help failing to load in Internet Explorer 11
- Fix `--help-web` not working on macOS when DISPLAY environment variable is undefined
- Change type of `ISession.tokenType` to "string" (for compatiblity with versions older than 4.7.0).

## `4.7.2`

- Hide sensitive session properties (user, password, and token value) in log file. Since 4.7.0, only password was hidden.

## `4.7.1`

- Don't load token value into Session object if user or password are supplied

## `4.7.0`

- Add the --dd flag to profile creation to allow the profile to be created without the default values specified for that profile.
- Use a token for authentication if a token is present in the underlying REST session object.
- Added a new ConnectionPropsForSessCfg.addPropsOrPrompt function that places credentials (including a possible token) into a session configuration object.
    - Plugins must use this function to create their sessions to gain the features of automatic token-handling and prompting for missing connection options.
    - Connection information is obtained from the command line, environment variables, a service profile, a base profile, or from an option's default value in a service profile's definition, in that order.
    - If key connection information is not supplied to any cor Zowe command, the command will prompt for:
        -  host
        -  port
        -  user
        -  and password
    - Any prompt will timeout after 30 seconds so that it will not hang an automated script.
- Add base profiles, a new type of profile which can store values shared between profiles of other types.
    - The properties that are currently recognized in a base profile are:
        - host
        - port
        - user
        - password
        - rejectUnauthorized
        - tokenType
        - tokenValue
    - To use base profiles in an Imperative-based CLI, define a `baseProfile` schema on your Imperative configuration object.
    - If the `baseProfile` schema is defined, base profile support will be added to any command that uses profiles.
- Due to new options (like tokenValue) help text will change. Plugin developers may have to update any mismatched snapshots in their automated tests.
- Updated the version of TypeScript from 3.7.4 to 3.8.0.
- Updated the version of TSLint from 5.x to 6.1.2.
- Add login and logout commands to get and delete/invalidate tokens
  - Add showToken flag to display token only, and not save it to the user profile
  - Add ability to create a user profile on login if no profile of that type existed previously
